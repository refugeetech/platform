          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Refugee Air is an initiative by a group of action-driven entrepreneurs and humanitarians. We know how
              to solve problems and get things done and we want to make a difference right now. We’re putting
              crowd-sourced competencies and our extensive networks to work to save lives and drive positive
              change.</p>
          <h3>The issue</h3>
          <p>Refugees without visas are currently not able to travel by air due to “Carriers Liability”, an EU
              directive making carriers financially liable for all costs related to passengers who are not
              ultimately granted asylum at their destination. Although budget flights on the same routes are cheap
              and easy to come by, refugees must instead pay thousand of euros to smugglers to undertake the
              dangerous sea crossing, risking their lives in the process.</p>

          <h3>What we want to achieve</h3>
          <p>Our mission is to circumvent the stumbling block of carriers liability and ensure the safe
              transportation of refugees into the EU by air. </p>

          <h3>What we want to achieve</h3>
          <p>Through crowd sourced collaboration and with the backing of private and corporate donors, Refugee Air
              is going to prove that the transportation issue can be solved. By collaborating with carriers,
              governments and the UNHCR, we are going to make safe routes into the EU a reality.</p>

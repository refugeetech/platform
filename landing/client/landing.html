                        <p class="text-muted">Refugees flee unstable areas to escape ongoing humanitarian crises and seek safety in their new home, Sweden. The arrival is often fraught with trauma and stressful bureaucracy. Providing support to newly arrived refugees in this step is critical to their success.</p>

We seek to offer resources and advice to refugees in this step to help refugees navigate the process of starting over in Sweden.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Often, refugees are put in boxes that deny their talents and contributions, or limit their opportunities due to language and/or cultural barriers. The final step is about breaking down these barriers and allowing people to fulfill their potential as citizens and professionals.</p>

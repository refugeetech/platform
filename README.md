## Introduction

The platform connects tech projects, public and private initiatives, challenges, crowdsourcing of challenges and crowdsourcing of ideas to solve challenges, volunteers and resources (cash, products & services, etc) and their respective sponsors. The platform is a nexus for community building and collaboration and a resource to bootstrap projects that are doing things that target the integration process.

The platform is made up of major parts that are integrated and intertwined:

* Project Hub: Contains Projects and Organizations
* Resource Hub: Funding (Grants(Cash, Material(Office space, Laptops, etc), Products&Services(Slack, Github, Etc), Knowledge(Expertise(Skills*Time):Volunteering, Information resources))
* Knowledge Hub: Challanges, Solutions, Ideas, Q&A, Forum  ,, ; Is crowdsourced 
* Associations: Relationships exist between project, challenges they target, other projects targeting a specific challenge, partners/financers/volunteers of a projects, etc.

## The purpose and background of the Project Hub

The project hub focuses on projects that are doing things for the integration of newly arrived. Tech projects are projects focuses on tech. There are other initiatives such as publicly or privately run refugee camps, transit housing, volunteering networks such as Refugees Welcome, and others.

## High level requirements of the minimum viable Project Hub

* Projects should be able to “apply” to be listed on the project hub.
* Tech projects and other initiatives are made distinct on the hub which makes it easy for visitors to know what kind of project it is*.
* Projects are searchable and filterable. They are presented in a nice and compelling list. Filter parameters are based on challenge category that the project is targeting.
* Projects can be targeting one or more specific issues under some category. These specific issues exists in our challenge hub as uniquely identifiable issues that has been found through our workshop or crowdsourcing activities.
* Projects have profiles that give information about their project and what they are doing and for whom. The previously mentioned “targeting” issues that projects are trying to solve is visible in the project profile. Clicking on such an issue shows a short summary of that issue. One can also browse to and redirect to the source (on the challenge hub if exists otherwise documents and other source files).
* Projects can make request for assistance. The format of these requests (when published) should be similar to Issues and presented as “project specific” issues/challenges and a reference to what skills are potentially needed to solve that issue**.
* Social account login (linkedin, twitter, facebook, google, openID)

`*` The most important reason for this distinction is our view of other initiatives not focusing on tech to be challenge owners; those who are working most closely with refugees. As challenge owners they are potential users or partners with tech
focused projects. This makes it important to facilitate cooperation between them. To make them distinct in the project hub
lifts this point somewhat. Of course tech project could be working just as close with refugees as other projects. But tech is a tool that needs to be distributed and applied. Most tech initiatives therefore needs partners who are working directly with refugees and who can distribute their tech solutions.

 `**`This data/presentation structure will create coherence throughout the platform and “drilldown” use cases. For example
one could start by browsing categories of Issue/challenges on the challenge/issue hub, then drill down to specific challenges and further down to projects specific challenges that are faced by projects targeting those issue. Finally one could be able to assist to a project specific issue using ones resources or knowledge as requested or by reaching out with a different idea of how to be able to help.

# Design
# User Interface terminology

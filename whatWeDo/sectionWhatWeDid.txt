Iteration 1 : pilotprocess
In our latest iteration the theme was Jobs and Integration. Thus we identified problems with relevant actors such as the swedish Arbetsförmedlingen, Incluso and others. We identified 4 challenges, went on to produce 4 solutions together with additional creatives from hyperisland and professional analysts from PwC. Finally our hackathon produced 4 prototypes showcasing how the solutions could be implemented to solve the initial challenges. These prototypes represent the beginning of a cycle that produces Refugee Tech Projects several times a year. RT Projects are the forerunners of tech inspired responses to integration challenges and will always strive for the highest standards in inclusive and open innovation for newcomers, with newcomers.

              This step lays the groundwork for us and our collaborators to identify sustainable solutions.</p>

                Techies, designers and engineers take the lead on creating the technology needed to develop these prototypes,
                which are then market tested by dedicated teams. <br> We involve relevant stakeholders in this process to ensure

This step is about product development, but it’s also about creating the necessary foundation to release the solution into the world. We hope that by keeping our projects open source, we can pave the way for other individuals or organizations to implement our solutions, apply our best practices and/or learn from our mistakes.</p>

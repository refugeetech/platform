                        Technology has historically been at the forefront of human advancement. We believe that
                        together, creative minds can harness technology to solve real world problems. That belief is at
                        the core of our mission: to use technology to connect, collaborate, and innovate in order to
                        solve problems faced by refugees today and in the future.

                          We build bridges between different parts of society to bring in stakeholders, innovators, and
                          tech-savvy people to design and develop creative solutions. We listen to refugees about the
                          problems they face, to organizations on the ground already working on solutions, and to creative
                          tech people. By bringing these voices into one conversation, we can find real solutions that
                          work.

                          We use these conversations, along with research and hard data to identify the most relevant and
                          urgent problems that could be solved by innovative technology. The best ideas generated during
                          this process are the ones that weâ€™ll turn into tools and services to improve the lives of
                          thousands of refugees.
